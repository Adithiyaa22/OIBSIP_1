# Task 1: Simple Landing Page Creation

## Overview
In this task, I have designed and developed a simple landing page for a food restaurant's booking order system. The landing page is created using HTML and CSS code. The goal is to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for customers to place their food orders conveniently.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Booking Order Form**: A user-friendly booking order form is included, allowing customers to select their desired items from the menu and specify any special requests or dietary preferences.
- **Clear Call-to-Action**: Prominent call-to-action buttons prompt users to place their orders or make reservations, encouraging them to take action without hesitation.
- **Engaging Visuals**: Visual elements such as images, colors, and typography are carefully chosen to create a welcoming atmosphere and evoke the essence of the restaurant's brand.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the landing page, including headings, paragraphs, images, and forms.
- CSS3: Utilized for styling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of the landing page to enhance user experience.
- Git and GitHub: Version control system and online repository platform used for managing and sharing project files and code.

## How to View the Landing Page
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone [Insert my respository url]
2. Open the `landpage.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the landing page.
